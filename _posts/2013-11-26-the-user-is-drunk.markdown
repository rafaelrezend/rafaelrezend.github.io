title: The User is Drunk!
---

[Will Dayble](http://willdayble.com/) from [squareweave](https://www.squareweave.com.au/) did a great job listing 5 techniques to test a user interface in a method called *the user is drunk*!

The video is hilarious and provides an interesting view of the *user* from a different perspective!
I could list the principles of this method, but definitely, my words wouldn't cause the same impact. So, worthy of watching!
